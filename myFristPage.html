<p>Lagaan was one of the biggest Bollywood hits in 2001 and only the third Indian film to be nominated for a U.S. Academy Award. Even as the film was a work of fiction, the script was very close to real life as the storyline was making the movie-watchers believe that something like this could have happened.28 Jan 2023 </p>

<p>The film Mission Majnu is inspired by true events. But it's not a true story, it's a fictionalized version of the real-life Operation Cactus. It is said that the film is set in the 1970s, when Pakistan was under dictatorship and the government had started a nuclear program. </p>
